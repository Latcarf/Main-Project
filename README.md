# Second Project

This project is a comprehensive Java web application developed using Spring Boot and follows the MVC architecture. It includes both admin and public-facing sections, providing functionality for managing real estate objects and handling user requests. The admin interface is designed to manage various entities and respond to user submissions, while the user interface allows browsing and submitting requests for real estate properties.

## Project Idea

The website is designed for real estate manipulation, featuring two main categories: new buildings and various real estate properties. Users can browse through listings, view detailed information, and submit requests. The admin panel provides a full suite of tools for managing real estate listings, user requests, and responding to inquiries.

## Key Features

- **Admin and User Interfaces**: Clear separation between admin and user roles, with a dedicated admin panel for managing content and requests.
- **Advanced CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality is available for real estate listings and requests, with optimized data management.
- **Dynamic Tables with Filtering**: The system displays dynamic tables with advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination options for effective data handling.
- **Export to Excel**: Users can export data from tables into Excel files, with the option to email the exported files directly.
- **Photo Management**: Integrated photo upload and management system, allowing users to upload photos for real estate properties.
- **Field Validation**: Validation mechanisms are in place to ensure data integrity, including regular expressions for accurate field validation.

## Additional Resources
